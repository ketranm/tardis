# TARDIS

Tardis stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
Yes, it is the [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS) from Dr. Who.

Did I mention the TARDIS looks like a BLEU telephone box. Oops, I meant blue telephone box.


A Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system developed at ILPS, University of Amsterdam.

## Features

- Standard Seq2seq model (we won't update this for now)
- Seq2seq with attention
- Fast LSTM/GRU
- Bilinear/Dot attention mechanism
- Hard Attention (using REINFORCE update rule)

## Planing
- Recurrent Memory Networks (in progress)
- Character LSMT models
- REINFORCE training NMT (in progress)
